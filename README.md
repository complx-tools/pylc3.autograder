# pylc3.autograder

Autograder and Unit testing framework for LC-3 code written in Python, exports test results in JSON. 

JSON output format is configurable. 

**Note** that this package doesn't export any grades. The intended use is just exporting the test results in JSON afterwards a script can then easily parse the JSON and assign points per each assertion passed.
